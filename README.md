This is the code from the book [*Express.js in Action*](http://manning.com/hahn/?a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7).

I've provided a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machine with Node (installed with [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)), the Express application generator, and MongoDB.
